# Sentilytics-TwitterSentimentAnalysis
This project focuses on detecting hate speech in tweets by classifying them as racist/sexist or non-racist/sexist.  
The dataset includes labeled tweets where: 
Label 1: Racist/Sexist sentiment. 
Label 0: Neutral or non-racist/sexist sentiment. 
The primary objective was to preprocess the data, extract features, and build machine learning models to classify sentiments effectively. The evaluation metric used for the project was F1-Score.
