# Sentilytics: Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
Sentilytics is a machine learning project aimed at detecting hate speech in tweets by classifying them into two categories:

- **Label 1**: Racist/Sexist sentiment.
- **Label 0**: Neutral or non-racist/sexist sentiment.

The project focuses on preprocessing text data, feature extraction, and implementing machine learning models to achieve accurate classification. The primary evaluation metric for this project is the **F1-Score** to ensure a balance between precision and recall, especially in detecting minority classes.

## Features
- **Hate Speech Detection**: Identifies and classifies tweets containing racist or sexist remarks.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning and normalization of text data to remove noise and prepare it for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Leverages text representation techniques such as TF-IDF, Bag of Words, or word embeddings.
- **Model Implementation**: Utilizes machine learning classifiers like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Focused on F1-Score for model performance evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset contains labeled tweets with the following details:

| Label | Description                      |
|-------|----------------------------------|
| 1     | Racist/Sexist sentiment          |
| 0     | Neutral or non-racist/sexist sentiment |

The dataset includes tweets with varying levels of textual complexity and sentiment polarity.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**
   - Import the dataset containing labeled tweets.
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Remove special characters, punctuation, and stopwords.
   - Tokenize and normalize text.
   - Perform stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Convert text data into numerical format using:
     - TF-IDF Vectorization
     - Count Vectorization (Bag of Words)
     - Word Embeddings (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec)
4. **Model Training**
   - Train multiple machine learning models such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - Naive Bayes Classifier
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate model performance using:
     - F1-Score
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - Accuracy
6. **Model Deployment** (Optional)
   - Package the model for integration into web or mobile applications.

## Dependencies
The project is built using Python and the following libraries:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **NLTK/Spacy**: For natural language processing tasks.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Results
The trained models achieved the following results (example):

| Model               | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.85      | 0.78   | 0.81     |
| SVM                 | 0.87      | 0.79   | 0.83     |
| Random Forest       | 0.82      | 0.76   | 0.79     |

## Future Improvements
